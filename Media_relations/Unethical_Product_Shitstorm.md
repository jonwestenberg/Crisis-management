# The Unethical Product Shit-Storm.
## Case study: Peeple

Peeple was a trainwreck of a startup. Essentially, it was an app that was intended to let users review other people with a rating system. It was widely billed as "Yelp for People" - and the ethical problems inherent in that service were apparently obvious to everyone except the founders of the company.

The startup didn't attract interest until the publication of a savage (and well deserved) piece in the Washington Post:

[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/30/everyone-you-know-will-be-able-to-rate-you-on-the-terrifying-yelp-for-people-whether-you-want-them-to-or-not/)
> It’s inherently invasive, even when complimentary. And it’s objectifying and reductive in the manner of all online reviews. One does not have to stretch far to imagine the distress and anxiety that such a system would cause even a slightly self-conscious person; it’s not merely the anxiety of being harassed or maligned on the platform — but of being watched and judged, at all times, by an objectifying gaze to which you did not consent. Where once you may have viewed a date or a teacher conference as a private encounter, Peeple transforms it into a radically public performance: Everything you do can be judged, publicized, recorded.

The backlash was intense, and it lasted for weeks. The founders were universally lambasted until they pivoted away from their dystopian concept. Unfortunately, along the way, they failed to respond to the worsening crisis effectively:

1. They insisted that the reporters didn't "Get" their concept.
2. They took the backlash as a personal attack and lashed out, accusing commentors of bullying. In fact, they even attempted to block people who were critical of their concept. 
3. They ignored the (valid) concerns of the media.
4. [They finally pivoted to a weak concept, abandoned their project and became irrelevant.](http://forthepeeple.com/) 

## Responding to an unethical product shitstorm:

When you have a product that is receiving intense backlash due to ethical concerns, the first exercise is always going to be analysis. Is there any basis to the accusations of unethical behaviour? What can you learn, constructively, from the feedback? It's worthwhile investigating whether or not the backlash has any footing. If you've become too caught up in the excitement of building and launching a product, it may be the case that you've lost sight of the people that you are going to hurt by launching it. 

Regardless of your conclusion, your first stage response to the media should be this:

[]Acknowledge the concerns around the ethics of your startup. 
[]Apologise for the negative impact that you have had.
[]Announce your intentions to fully investigate the concerns. 
[]Invite public commentary through a dedicated email address.
