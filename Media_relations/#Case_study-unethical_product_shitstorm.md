# The Unethical Product Shit-Storm.
## Case study: Peeple

Peeple was a trainwreck of a startup. Essentially, it was an app that was intended to let users review other people with a rating system. It was widely billed as "Yelp for People" - and the ethical problems inherent in that service were apparently obvious to everyone except the founders of the company.

The concept of Peeple follows the formula of hundreds of social apps that are pumped out every month. Take an established model (Yelp, for reviews), and apply it to a new ‘sector’ (human beings, instead of restaurants).

It allows people to leave a one-to-five star rating for anyone in the world. by Julia Cordray and Nicole McCullough, Peeple has been in development for over a year. Their online documentary series launched on 9 August 2015, documenting their 90-day launch process in Silicon Valley. However, it wasn’t until an interview in the Washington Post titled ‘Everyone you know will be able to rate you on the terrifying ‘Yelp for people’ — whether you want them to or not’ on September 30 that people started to take notice.

One does not have to stretch far to imagine the distress and anxiety that such a system would cause even a slightly self-conscious person; it’s not merely the anxiety of being harassed or maligned on the platform — but of being watched and judged, at all times, by an objectifying gaze to which you did not consent. Where once you may have viewed a date or a teacher conference as a private encounter, Peeple transforms it into a radically public performance: Everything you do can be judged, publicized, recorded.

The backlash was intense, and it lasted for weeks. The founders were universally lambasted until they pivoted away from their dystopian concept. Unfortunately, along the way, they failed to respond to the worsening crisis effectively:

1. They insisted that the reporters didn't "Get" their concept.
2. They took the backlash as a personal attack and lashed out, accusing commentors of bullying.
3. They ignored the (valid) concerns of the media.
4. [They finally pivoted to a weak concept, abandoned their project and disappeared.](http://forthepeeple.com/) 

## Where They Went Wrong

When you have a product that is receiving intense backlash due to ethical concerns, the first exercise is always going to be analysis. Is there any basis to the accusations of unethical behaviour? What can you learn, constructively, from the feedback? It's worthwhile investigating whether or not the backlash has any footing. If you've become too caught up in the excitement of building and launching a product, it may be the case that you've
