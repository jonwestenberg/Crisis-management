# Media Relations
When a startup experiences a press crisis, it can be an enormous setback that destroys months of hard work. Negative media coverage even has the ability to completely shutter a company. A media crisis is the most difficult for a startup to manage. Remember, it is in the best interests of the media to make a scandal or an issue appear worse or to avoid reporting on closure. Outrage drives clicks more than resolution.

The most frequent media relations problems are:
* A startup failing to deliver on their promises.
* A startup being out of touch with the mainstream.
* [A startup pushing an ethically questionable product.](https://github.com/jonwestenberg/Crisis-management/blob/master/Media_relations/%23Case_study-unethical_product_shitstorm.md#the-unethical-product-shit-storm)
* A startup not asking permission.
* A startup experiencing a misunderstanding with the media. 

The case studies provided for each of these media crises should be reviewed before moving on to the response stage guidelines.
