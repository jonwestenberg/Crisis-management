# Media Relations
When a startup experiences bad press, it can be an enormous setback that destroys months of hard work. Negative media coverage even has the ability to completely destroy a company. The articles that cover your startup can focus on any number of things, but the most frequent media relations problems are:
* A startup failing to deliver on their promises.
* A startup being out of touch with the mainstream.
* A startup pushing an ethically questionable product.

* A startup not asking permission.
* A startup experiencing a misunderstanding with the media.
