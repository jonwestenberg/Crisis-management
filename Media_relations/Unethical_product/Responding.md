## Responding to an unethical product shitstorm.

When you have a product that is receiving intense backlash due to ethical concerns, the first exercise is always going to be analysis. Is there any basis to the accusations of unethical behaviour? What can you learn, constructively, from the feedback? It's worthwhile investigating whether or not the backlash has any footing. If you've become too caught up in the excitement of building and launching a product, it may be the case that you've lost sight of the people that you are going to hurt by launching it. 

Regardless of your conclusion, your first stage response to the media should be this:

* As the founder, take centre stage and demonstrate that you have nothing to hide.
* Arrange for an interview with both the original media outlet who picked up on your story, and the most recent to have covered it.
* Acknowledge the concerns around the ethics of your startup. 
* Apologise for the negative impact that you have had.
* Announce your intentions to fully investigate the concerns. 
* Invite public commentary through a dedicated email address.
* create a public information page that contains the allegations against your company as well as your own controlled response.

This response positions your startup as an open organisation, ready to learn and take new information, humble be willing to change but also mature / confident / highly professional. 

Do not make your first response a personal defence from the founders. Make it an opportunity for the founders to be liked, respected and listened to.

Do not make your first response a standard "no comment" - this suggests you have something to hide and are panicking. It fuels the fire. 

Do not make your first response a tweet storm. Do not attempt to respond to any negative tweets about your startup.
