# Crisis Management For Startups.
![Guide Cover](http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l360/Jonwestenberg/Crisis%20management%20for%20startups._zpsaduspamq.png)

This guide is intended to offer startup founders a quick action handbook to use when responding to crises. Essentially, startup founders are often ill equipped to deal with challenging issues around the media, their industry, their staff or their community. While focused on building their product, and utilising the skills that are highly tuned to that project, founders do not have public or internal relations experience.
For founders who find themselves in a crisis situation, the first, second and third responses can determine the future of their company. Failing to respond effectively often leads to a community fallout, a staff exodus, or so much bad press that it can be impossible to recover.
