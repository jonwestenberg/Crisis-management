# Crisis Management For Startups.
![Guide Cover](http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l360/Jonwestenberg/Crisis%20management%20for%20startups._zpsaduspamq.png)

This guide is intended to offer startup founders a quick action handbook to use when responding to crises. Essentially, startup founders are often ill equipped to deal with challenging issues around the media, their industry, their staff or their community. While focused on building their product, and utilising the skills that are highly tuned to that project, founders do not have public or internal relations experience.

For founders who find themselves in a crisis situation, the way you respond to a tough situation can determine the future of their company. Failing to respond effectively often leads to a community fallout, a staff exodus, or so much bad press that it can be impossible to recover. 

**There are three response stages in any crisis situation:**
 1. Recognition of the issues.
 2. Current actions.
 3. Future preventative actions.

This guide will go through the appropriate responses for each of these stages, providing guidelines for startup founders to follow when facing a crisis. There are four crisis situations covered - media relations, community relations, staff relations and industry relations. Each situation covered here provides you with a task list, response templates and case studies.

I encourage you to clone, modify and use this guide inside your own organisation.
